Upload
This page shows a button for browsing and selection local files and a button
for uploading. Some attacks using upload features include denial of service
after filling the entire disk of the web application server machine. But as
there is validation for file size, we should upload lots of files with some
script.

Another possible exploitation is to upload malicious code and run it on the
server-side of the web application. As the server only automatically runs files
with php extension, we have to bypass the html form. I could do it on the
browser (firefox), setting the raw headers of my POST request, so the
'Content-type' flag was a jpeg image, but the file uploaded was php code. Then,
I could run it by accessing it on
"http://10.0.23.21/hackable/uploads/filename.php". As the server trusts it's
own code, it's very dangerous because the script has basically no limits on the
application context, at least.
