Reflected XSS
In this page, it is possible to abuse the fact that there is almost no
validation on what you can write on the field "name" of the form. So HTML (and
possibly, JavaScript) strings in the content of the field get interpreted as
well. There is indeed a replace for strings with "<script>" inside them, but we
can workaround this by using "<ScRiPt>", or by adding useless tags like "<script something="">"

We can see that what we type actually goes to this page as a param, so we could
inject code in the url instead of the field, just like
"http://10.0.23.21/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<scripT>alert("hello")</script>"
and then send this modified URL to a possible victim.

This can be dangerous because the script inserted on the page runs on the
client side on every browser that triggers it, so any info loaded at the moment
on the page could be gathered (for example, email, login, session tokens or
cookies) and be sent to an attacker.
