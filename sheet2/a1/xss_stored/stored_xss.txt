Stored XSS
In this page, it is possible to abuse the fact that there is almost no
validation on what you can write on the field "name" of the form. So HTML (and
possibly, JavaScript) strings in the content of the field get interpreted as
well. There is indeed a replace for strings with "<script>" inside them, but we
can workaround this by using "<ScRiPt>", or by adding useless tags like "<script something="">"

Another small inconvenient is that the max length allowed for characters in
that field is limited by 10, but we can easily workaround that with the browser
inspector, setting it manually to 100 or over.

A funny proof of concept was, after set the max length with the inspector,
to write this on the "name" field. This inserts a big image with an annoying
effect that, when you move you mouse over it, a popup is shown.

<img src="https://bit.ly/2DBQy1V" onmouseover="alert('H3Y TH3R3');">
Or even:
<object type="text/html" width="600" height="900" data="http://www.news.de/index.html"></object>
Or, more simply put:
<ScRiPt>alert('H3y th3r3');</script>

This can be dangerous because the script inserted on the page runs on the
client side on every browser that triggers it, so any info loaded at the moment
on the page can be gathered (for example, email, login, session tokens or
cookies) and be sent to an attacker.
