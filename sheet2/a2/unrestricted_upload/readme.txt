Unrestricted file upload:
After some trials, I could see that when I upload files with extensions like
html or php, the album tries to interprete them.  So, as demanded, I wrote a
simple PHP script that can be uploaded to the webpage to get access to a
terminal-like page that runs commands on the server. To use it, simply upload
it into an album (My Graffiti), and then click on the picture.
