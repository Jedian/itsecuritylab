XSS Worm:
When the malicious code is posted on a pinboard, every user who
access the page with the worm get it's own pinboard infected and
automatically infects all his friends with the exact same code.

As friendship is mutual in this application, a pinboard can be infected several
times exponentially fast, causing the server to lag a bit on accessing pages.
